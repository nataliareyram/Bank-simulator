# Bank Account simulator
#Idea: The goal of this project is to create a bank account simulator that includes essential banking features, such as deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry. This simulator serves as a practical and interactive tool that allows users to engage with core financial operations in a safe, simulated environment. Moreover, it will help the users develop important skills, such as financial literacy, logical thinking, and problem-solving, thus enhancing their technical knowledge while making the learning process enjoyable and accessible. Thanks to the class diagram drawn beforehand, this simulator will have a blueprint amd rubric to be followed in order to ensure the integration of all the elements intended, and to have a seamless relation between all the classes involved.




#Context and justification: The choice of this project stems from its relevance to a wide array of programming concepts that will be discussed in class, such as OOP and C++ knowledge. Designing a bank account system requires an understanding of data handling, user interface design, and other essential skills in computer science and software development.
